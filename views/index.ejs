  <h1>ðŸŒ± Welcome to PowerSprout</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>PowerSprout</strong> is an IoT-based Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) monitoring system
    that tracks key biological and environmental parameters in real-time to ensure optimal energy generation and safe operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using sensors for <strong>pH, gas concentration (methane), weight, and temperature</strong>, PowerSprout collects and displays live data
    from the MFC system. It provides real-time alerts through buzzers and LEDs when safety thresholds are exceeded.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is designed to support research, automation, and educational insights into how microbial systems can be used for sustainable energy production.
